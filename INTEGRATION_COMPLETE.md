# ‚úÖ Scanner Integration Complete

## Summary

The Security Headers Scanner and XXE Scanner have been successfully integrated into the main HackTheWeb application!

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Scanner Module Initialization** (`hacktheweb/scanners/__init__.py`)
Added imports for new scanners:
```python
from hacktheweb.scanners.security_headers_scanner import SecurityHeadersScanner
from hacktheweb.scanners.xxe_scanner import XXEScanner
```

### 2. **Integrated into Core Scanner** (`hacktheweb/core/scanner.py`)
- Added imports for both new scanners
- Registered scanners in the `scanners` dictionary:
  - `'security_headers': SecurityHeadersScanner`
  - `'xxe': XXEScanner`
- Both scanners are now part of the main scanning workflow

### 3. **Updated AI Engine** (`hacktheweb/core/ai_engine.py`)
- Added `'security_headers': 'low'` to severity rules
- XXE was already present as `'high'` severity
- AI engine can now prioritize these vulnerability types

### 4. **Enhanced CLI** (`hacktheweb/cli.py`)
Updated `list-techniques` command to show:
- ‚úÖ **Security Headers** - Implemented
- ‚úÖ **XXE** - Implemented
- Added status column to clearly show implemented vs planned features

### 5. **Updated Documentation** (`README.md`)
- Added ‚úÖ checkmarks for implemented scanners
- Added ‚è≥ for planned scanners
- Security Headers scanner is now documented

---

## Verification

### ‚úÖ All Tests Passed

1. **Import Test**: Both scanners import successfully
   ```bash
   from hacktheweb.scanners import SecurityHeadersScanner, XXEScanner
   ```

2. **CLI Test**: Scanners appear in techniques list
   ```bash
   python3 -m hacktheweb.cli list-techniques
   ```
   Shows both scanners with "‚úÖ Implemented" status

3. **Integration Test**: Scanners are registered in core Scanner
   - security_headers scanner: ‚úÖ
   - xxe scanner: ‚úÖ

---

## How the Scanners Work

### Security Headers Scanner
**Checks for:**
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-XSS-Protection
- Referrer-Policy
- Permissions-Policy

**Detects:**
- Missing security headers
- Misconfigured headers (weak CSP, short HSTS max-age)
- Information disclosure headers (Server, X-Powered-By)

**Severity:** Low to Medium

### XXE Scanner
**Tests for:**
- File disclosure via XXE
- SSRF via XXE
- Denial of Service (Billion Laughs attack)
- Out-of-band XXE

**Targets:**
- Forms accepting XML
- URL parameters accepting XML
- Direct XML endpoints
- Content-Type: application/xml

**Severity:** High to Critical

---

## Usage

Both scanners are automatically included in scans:

```bash
# Full scan (includes all scanners)
python3 -m hacktheweb.cli scan https://example.com

# The AI engine will prioritize scanners based on:
# - Detected technologies
# - Attack surface analysis
# - Vulnerability severity
```

---

## Scanner Priority in AI Engine

The AI engine prioritizes scanners based on:

1. **Technology Detection**
   - If XML endpoints detected ‚Üí XXE scanner prioritized
   - Always runs Security Headers scanner (baseline check)

2. **Severity Scoring**
   - XXE: High severity (7.0 base score)
   - Security Headers: Low severity (2.0 base score)

3. **Context-Aware**
   - More forms ‚Üí Higher XSS/CSRF priority
   - Database indicators ‚Üí Higher SQLi priority
   - XML processing ‚Üí Higher XXE priority

---

## What's Next?

From the improvement roadmap (`IMPROVEMENTS.md`), the next high-priority scanners to implement are:

1. **RCE Scanner** (2-3 hours)
   - Command injection detection
   - Code execution vulnerabilities
   - Template injection

2. **IDOR Scanner** (2-3 hours)
   - Direct object reference testing
   - Access control bypass
   - Parameter manipulation

3. **Open Redirect Scanner** (1-2 hours)
   - URL redirection vulnerabilities
   - Header injection

4. **CORS Scanner** (1-2 hours)
   - CORS misconfiguration detection
   - Cross-origin resource sharing issues

---

## Testing Recommendations

To test the new scanners:

### 1. Test Security Headers Scanner
```bash
# Test on a site with missing headers
python3 -m hacktheweb.cli scan https://example.com --scanners security_headers
```

Expected findings:
- Missing HSTS header
- Missing or weak CSP
- Information disclosure headers

### 2. Test XXE Scanner
```bash
# Test on a site with XML endpoints
python3 -m hacktheweb.cli scan https://xmlapi.example.com
```

Expected behavior:
- Detects XML forms and endpoints
- Tests file disclosure payloads
- Tests SSRF via XXE
- Reports XXE vulnerabilities if found

### 3. Full Integration Test
```bash
# Run complete scan on a test target
python3 -m hacktheweb.cli scan https://testphp.vulnweb.com
```

All 7 scanners should run:
- XSS Scanner ‚úÖ
- SQLi Scanner ‚úÖ
- CSRF Scanner ‚úÖ
- SSRF Scanner ‚úÖ
- LFI Scanner ‚úÖ
- Security Headers Scanner ‚úÖ
- XXE Scanner ‚úÖ

---

## Configuration

Both scanners respect the global configuration:

```yaml
# config/default_config.yaml
scanning:
  max_threads: 10
  timeout: 30
  max_payloads_per_test: 50
  
security_headers:
  check_all: true
  include_info_headers: true
  
xxe:
  test_file_disclosure: true
  test_ssrf: true
  test_dos: false  # Disable destructive tests
  use_oob: false   # Out-of-band testing (requires callback server)
```

---

## Developer Notes

### Adding More Scanners

To add a new scanner:

1. **Create Scanner File** (`hacktheweb/scanners/your_scanner.py`)
   ```python
   class YourScanner:
       async def scan(self, target, recon_data):
           # Implement scanning logic
           return vulnerabilities
   ```

2. **Update `__init__.py`**
   ```python
   from hacktheweb.scanners.your_scanner import YourScanner
   ```

3. **Register in Core Scanner** (`hacktheweb/core/scanner.py`)
   ```python
   scanners = {
       'your_vuln': YourScanner(self.config, self.session),
   }
   ```

4. **Add to AI Engine** (`hacktheweb/core/ai_engine.py`)
   ```python
   severity_rules = {
       'your_vuln': 'high',
   }
   ```

5. **Update CLI** (`hacktheweb/cli.py`)
   ```python
   techniques = [
       ("Your Vuln", "Description", "‚úÖ Implemented"),
   ]
   ```
